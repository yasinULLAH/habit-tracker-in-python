# Habit Tracker in Python 📝

This is a simple yet effective habit tracking application built using Python, Streamlit, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The app allows users to track daily habits, visualize their progress over time, and maintain streaks to stay motivated.

## Features 🌟

- **Add and Manage Habits**: Easily add new habits and manage existing ones.
- **Track Progress**: Mark habits as completed each day and track your progress visually.
- **View Statistics**: See a graphical view of your habit completion and analyze your progress.
- **Streak Counter**: Automatically calculates your current streak for each habit to keep you motivated.
- **Delete Habits**: If needed, you can remove habits from the tracker.

## How It Works 🚀

1. **Add a Habit**: Define a habit you want to track, such as "Exercise" or "Read a Book."
2. **Mark Completion**: Each day, mark the habit as completed.
3. **Visualize Progress**: View your habit completion over the last 30 days in a clean, graphical format.
4. **Monitor Streaks**: The app calculates your current streak based on consecutive days of completion.
5. **View Statistics**: See the full breakdown of your habit completion with date-based visualizations.
6. **Delete a Habit**: Remove a habit from the tracker when it's no longer relevant.
